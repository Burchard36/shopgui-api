This repository provides an open source library containing basic API for [ShopGUI+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/shopgui-1-7-1-14.6515/) spigot plugin.

## How to use
1. Add Maven/Gradle dependency to your project (code snippets are available in the section below)
2. Add `ShopGUIPlus` to `depend` or `softdepend` section of `plugin.yml` in your plugin project
3. You can start adding desired implementation to your plugin

Tips:
* Registering of spawner provider must be performed at server startup (inside the `onEnable` method of your plugin)
* You can get ShopGUI+'s main class with `ShopGuiPlusApi#getPlugin` static method
* The API is still very basic and incomplete - we're open for ideas as well as pull requests

## Version compatibility matrix
When using this API, make sure you use valid version corresponding to ShopGUI+'s version your plugin is going to be used with.

| ShopGUI+ version  | API version |
| --- | --- |
| 1.20.x | 1.0.0  


## Dependencies
_Note: It's not recommended to use the `latest` version tag. Use fixed version from [Releases](../releases) instead._

## Example implementations
There is an official example of implementing a spawners provider available at our GitHub:
* [MySpawners - example of spawners plugin hooking into ShopGUI+](https://github.com/brcdev-minecraft/shopgui-api-example-spawner-provider)

More example plugins showing API possibilities are coming soon.
